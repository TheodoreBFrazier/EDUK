						The goal of EDUK to connect highschool, college students, minority
						groups and residents of underserved communities to resources that
						they wouldnâ€™t have access to otherwise. <br /> <br /> Whether it be
						career tips , scholarships , grants, continued learning, programs,
						etc, We hope to bridge the the knowledge gap within these
						underserved communities. We want to eliminate the gatekeeping of
						much needed information and create a hub/gateway where people can
						easily find resources they desperately need to improve their quality
						of life.
