# EDUK

App Description

The goal of this app is to connect highschool/college students , minority groups and residents of underserved communities to resources that they wouldnâ€™t have access to otherwise.Whether it be career tips , scholarships , grants, continued learning, programs, etc, We hope to bridge the the knowledge gap within these underserved communities. We want to eliminate the gatekeeping of much needed information and create a hub/gateway where people can easily find resources they desperately need to improve their quality of life.
